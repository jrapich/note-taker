  ## Description
  This project is our first full stack homework assignment we are working on. We are given the front end and are made to make the backend work. This app will allow you a basic way of taking and saving notes, and returning later to view and study them if needed.

  ## Installation
  No installation necessary, as all logic occurs on the backend and server is already deployed. The project does however use node and express to function on the backend server.

  ## Usage
  Simply navigate to the project url <URL here> the site uses a wildcard route so any path passed in the url will return the main landing page. By clicking on the notes button in the center of the landing page, you will be navigated to /notes where the saved notes can be viewed on the left side. Enter any notes you would like t0o save in the text fields, and a save icon will appear in the top right. Click that to save your node, it will be stored on the server. Any notes you save will appear and persist on the left hand side, and can be accesed later for future studying. There is a delete option for the notes on the left side, but the delete functionaltiy is currently buggy on the server side and isnt working properly.
